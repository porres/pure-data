#X text 180 102 When you call an abstraction by typing \, say \, "sendnumber 1 x" in an object box. The subpatch can access the values of the creation arguments (1 and x) as "\$1" and "\$2" inside object boxes. Typing \$1 inside a message box serves a different purpose (refer back to 10.more.messages for details)., f 61;
